                    <h1>Education</h1>
                    <h3>Peking University </h3>
                    <p>
			Double major in Physics and Computer Science
                    </p>
		    <p>
			Expected to graduate June 2019
		    </p>
<p>
I am currently a third-grade student at Peking University, Beijing, China. My major is physics and I am doing a double degree in Computer Science.  Until this semester, I devoted myself evenly in the two majors and got a overall GPA of 3.5 according to my college scoring system. 
</p>

<div id="myDIV">
<p>
	I decided to pursue Computer Science as my main focus last year. Now, I already joined Tong Yang’s research group, improving algorithms for data streaming tasks.  
	
<p>	
	I graduated from Beijing No.4 high school which is considered to be one of the best high school in Beijing. I was trained as a member of the school team to compete in the The International Physics Olympiad (IPHO). 
</p>
<p>
	Before high school, I developed a lot of hobbies and interests. I attend music and Piano lessons at Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. When I entered high school, my piano skill reached the level of professional player and I attended the selective trial for International Smetana Piano Competition. Now, I play in clubs at school and studied music theories as a hobby.

                        My main focus are data streaming algorithms and machine learning.

			<p>I am now in a research group of the Institution of network computing and information 			systems at my school. During the previous semester, I worked out a improved algorithm for the 				frequency estimation problem, using probability-based adding counters to make 				better use of the memory. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Other than that,  I did some projects using learning algorithms with my teammates, including Chinese word segmentation and verification code recognition. In these projects, I got a general knowledge of the basic learning algorithms like SVM, KNN and perceptrons, and also, deep learning algorithms like CNN.

                    <h1>Skills</h1>

                    <h3>language </h3>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to languages, I am a bilingual in Chinese and English. I feel comfortable doing academic reading, writing and speaking using both of these two languages, as I got 30 out of 30 in TOEFL reading section and 29 in listening.
                    </p>
		    <h3>programming</h3>
		    <p>
			For programming languages, I use C++ on a daily basis and I also could code in Python, making use of those powerful packages and libraries. </p>

<div id="c3">
<p>
I did quite a lot of Online-Judge coding problems and also actual projects so I believe I am able to write good codes in these languages. Since I also major in Physics, I know other softwares including Mathematica, Matlab and ROOT, a modular scientific software framework.
		    </p>
                    <h3>hobbies!</h3>
		<p>
I have a lot of hobbies! Probably because I had a wide range of interests starting from an young age,  I like classical music very much and I am quite skillful at playing the piano. I also understand basic music theories, especially in harmonic analysis and polyphonic music like the fugues by J.S. Bach.I like calligraphy, in both English letters and Chinese characters. I am also a fan of the game of chess~
